   `$ cd catbot`

   `$ npm install`

   `$ ngrok http 3000`

1. If you haven't already, head over to https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create and create a Chatbot named **catbot**.


1. Add your https Ngrok URL and slash command to your Chatbot app in the Zoom App Marketplace:

   | Input        | Description | Example Value           |
